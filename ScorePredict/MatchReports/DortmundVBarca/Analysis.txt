Matchweek 6 of UCL saw a series of entertaining matches with the table shaping up now before the knockout rounds. One of those matches took place in Germany where Dortmund hosted Barcelona at the Signal Iduna Park. Both team had been successful in the UCL so far and had a chance to cement their position in the top 5 by this encounter.

And the game did not disappoint, it was an end to end game with both teams having multiple chances to go ahead but it all came down to who was clinical in front of the goal and that is where Barcelona won the game. Although Dortmund had a higher xG showing how they underperformed their xG due to not been able to convert their chances , Barcelona on the other hand overperformed their xG with pin point finishing.
Both teams were comparable on the number of shots and possession values showing that this match could go anywhere till the last whistle.

2 and 3-
All 5 goals came in the second half of the match as no real opportunities came for either team in the first one. Both teams were maintaining their defensive shape as Barca was playing their high line trying to cause offsides for every Dortmund attack and Dortmund were successful in containing Barcelona to avoid them to create them from the center of the pitch with a mid block.
Barcelona had much more possession in the first half (71%) and had 7 shots as compared to 3 from Dortmund , with a xG of 0.67 as compared to 0.4 from Dortmund.

The game started to pickup from the second half as both teams committed more numbers into attacks to get the first goal. Raphina scored the first after Olmo won a duel in the center of pitch from a Dortmund attack and played Raphinha who stayed onside brilliantly to score y putting the ball low across Kobel into the bottom corner.
Dortmund responded back quickly after conceding and won a penalty when Guirassy was fouled by Cubarsi in the penalty box which was converted elegantly by the big number 9 of Dortmund.

After the equaliser both teams had good momentum to gain the lead but it was Barcelona again who scored when Yamal played a through ball to Kounde behind the defensive line to who played a low cross which was hit by Fermin first time and saved by Kobel only for Torres to convert it from 2 yards out on the rebound. This goal against the run of play as Dortmund was starting to show their dominance and cause threats to the high defensive line from the Spanish team.

But they equalised again shortly after a poor pass from Martinez to give away the ball which was played above the high line again to Pascol Gross who stayed onside this time to square it to Guirassy again who scored on a empty net as Pena committed foolishly.

After scoring, Dortmund again looked dangerous and was looking as if they could get the third goal for the win but once again Barca scored in the last minutes on fast break from the winning the ball back.Yamal received the ball from Pedri and played a silky pass between the defenders to supply Torres who at first looked a little too much time to shoot but placed his shot precisely into the bottom corner again to score the winner.

One of the standout players of the match was the young prodigy of Barcelona, Lamine Yamal. He once again showed why he is one of the best creators in Europe right now with both his passing abilities and dribbling.
The weight of his passes for every through ball was almost perfect breaking defensive lines with ease. He was able to complete 4 take ons from 9 showcasing his dribbling skills on that right hand flank. His close control to beat his man and create chances for his striker is something we have already seen a number of times this season. He is proving to be one of the most important players for Hansi Flick and if he remains injury free we could see one of the greatest seasons from a youngster in a long time.

Serhou Guirassy was once again pivotal for Nuri Sahin's team bagging in 2 goals against Barcelona. Due to his height he is a natural target man in the box which is why Dortmund's wingers try to find him on the end of crosses from out wide which happened in this game too. But with his strong physical presence he is very affective in receiving passes deep inside his own box to hold up the ball to free up his team from opponent's pressure.

He had a total of 5 shots in this game, including one penalty which he won himself, with 3 on target. We can surely say that his transfer from Stuttgart last season has turned out to be one of the best transfers in Europe this season.

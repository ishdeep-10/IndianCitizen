The city of Milan witnessed another derby yesterday between the two rivals out of which the red side would be much more happy of the result than the blue. AC Milan who are struggling to make top 4 this season carved a draw against a team who is going for the title.
As the shot stats suggest, Inter should have scored more goals in the match with much better chances throughout the 90 mins.
Out of their 17 total shots, Inter had 12 shots from inside the box with three shots hitting the same goal post creating an xg of 2 with an xGOT of 1.7. Inter were much more dominant in possession too with 544/595 accurate passes compared to 305/360 from Milan.
And 44 touches in opposition box compared to only 18.
However Milan showed their defensive resilience who won more ground and aerial duels than Inter and Milan's keeper had a wonderful game creating 5 essential saves to keep his team in the lead for the longest time.

Neither team created much in the first 30 mins with attempting 11 shots in total with an xg of 0.65 from Milan and 0.43 from Inter. Possession was comparable too 41-59
However it was Milan who broke the deadlock from a point black thumping finish from Reijnders resulted from an impressive run from Leao from the left wing.
Milan's shots had much more probability to be resulted in a goal in terms of saving the shot as they had an xGOT of 0.98 in the first half.

Inter were producing much more end results from their time on the ball with attempting 10 shots, double to that from Milan with 4 of them on target with an xg of 0.92 and xGOT of 1.12. Any other day they would have comfortable scored atleast 2 more goals but luck was surely not on their side.

Milan would have thought that they have successfully cleared the danger of conceding even one goal from plethora of chances but Inter left it till the injury time to score the equaliser when De Vrij scored from close range again of a wonderful cross polish substitute Zalewski.

Barella -

Another midfield masterclass from the Italian maestro, Barella who was pivotal for Inter in possession with 80 touches (second most among all players, behind De Vrij) all around the pitch showing what a box to box midfielder looks like.

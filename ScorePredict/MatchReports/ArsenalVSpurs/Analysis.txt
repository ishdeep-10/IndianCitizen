North London Derby at the Emirates is always a fixture all premier league fans are really excited for because of the intensity with which both teams step onto the pitch on.
Midweek match between the two sides who although being very far from each other in the PL table still was a clash of equals as each team loves to grab the bragging rights to be called the best team in London.
Arsenal however grabbed these rights this time at their home with a convincing win of 2-1 over their city rivals.
Although both teams had comparable possession over the 90 mins, Arsenal looked much more threatening on the ball with being superior in all attacking stats. With accumulating a sum of 1.45 xG with 14 shots , Arsenal should have scored more than 2 goals considering their chances whereas Spurs with a xG of 0.78 with 11 shots looked like they were not having their best day in the final third.
Arsenal were much more dominant in terms of passing number too with completing 357 out of their 426 passes attempted as compared to 314/375 from Spurs. An interesting number here is that out of their total passes, Arsenal had 230 passes in the opposition half which is more than double from that of Spurs (109) as a result of which they had 48 touches in the Spurs's opposition box which was again double to that of Spurs (21).

The flow of the match in terms of expected threat values was dominated by Arsenal almost throughout the game with Spurs having some surges in between for a couple of mins.
Arsenal had 63% possession in the first half with 4 shots attempted with a cumulative G of 0.3 , surprisingly Spurs having much less possession had a xG of 0.33 with total of 2 shots. And moreover Spurs also scored the first goal against the run of play, hurting Arsenal in their own strengths when Son scored in the 25th minute resulting from a Corner which was poorly cleared out and hit by the Spurs captain which was deflected and rolled into the bottom corner.
However this didn't hamper Arsenal's attacking threat much as they continued to grow into the game and scored after 15 minutes, with another goal resulting from a Corner met by Gabriel who has already scored many goals for the Gunners in this season. Although this goal was awarded as an Own Goal by Solanke, it was a well worked corner routine with a deep cross slotted in to the far post sending everyone in the wrong direction.
Arsenal doubled their lead shortly after at the 44th minute , when Partey dispossessed Bissouma with a perfect tackle high up the pitch which was collected by Odegaard and quickly played out wide to Trossard who took a great touch and placed the ball powerfully from a tight angle into the corner which erupted the Emirates as Arsenal got their deserved lead.
The game opened up a little bit more in the second half as Spurs tried to score the equalizer as a result of which Arsenal got several oppurtunities to increase their lead on the counter attacks but both teams failed to convert any of their chances.

The player in focus who was monumental to Arsenal's dominance was the Norway international Martin Odegaard.
He had the most Key Passes (4) out of anyone else in important areas which led to shot creating actions and also had 74 touches only behind Gray (78) on the right hand side of Arsenal's midfield which shows how Arsenal was successful in finding their playmaker throughout the game. Receiving 54 passes too signifies how well he combined with his winger making in behind runs and also helping out his defenders to receive ball in tight areas and keeping possession.
He also received 2 key passes out of which he was able to strike 2 shots out of which he should have scored atleast one which would have certainly made his complete performance fruitful.
P.S. As per official stats he grabbed an assist for Trossard's goal however as it was not intentional opta data didn't record that pass as an assist.

A big match in the Seria A never ever disappoints specially if it is the Derby d'Italia!
8 goals in one of the biggest matches of the season in the Italian league is an absolutely rare occurrence.
Both teams were clinical in front of goal, converting their chances effectively.
Juventus edged Inter in terms of possession but Inter had much more bigger and better chances specially in the first half of the game. Almost each stat of this match shows how even this game was but in truth Juventus late comeback was not seen coming by many.

First half featured five goals beginning with Marcus Thuram winning a penalty after a clumsy challenge, which Zielinski converted coolly comfortably.

Juve equalised five minutes later through Dusan Vlahovic after a nice finish selflessly assisted by Weston Mckenni, and further took the lead through a strike from Timothy Weah within next 6 minutes.

After Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised following a neat piece of interplay with Thuram in the 35th minute, Zielinski scored his second penalty of the game to put Inter back on top 3-2.

Dumfries extended Inter's advantage early in the second half, converting at the back post after a corner was flicked into his path, but Juventus were not to be denied a share of the spoils.

Substitute Yildiz reduced the deficit for Juve in the 71st minute, placing an angled drive into the far corner, then stunned San Siro by firing home at the back post eight minutes from time. What a performance by the substitute!

Real Madrid’s defensive actions (left heatmap) are concentrated in their own half, particularly around the penalty area, indicating a low-block defensive setup.
Manchester City’s defensive actions (right heatmap) are more spread across the field, showing a high pressing system, with several actions in midfield and the opposition half.

Real Madrid (white line) had fluctuating pressing intensity, sometimes engaging aggressively (PPDA < 5), but at times dropping off significantly (PPDA > 15), showing a situational pressing strategy.
Manchester City (blue line) had a consistently aggressive press, particularly in the second half, maintaining a lower PPDA value throughout key phases.

City's pressing did not turn fruitful enough though as Madrid were able to easily bypass them with a extra man in midfield and connecting well with their fullbacks to release them in wider areas.
Madrid's plan out of possession was to be in a mid block and allowing City to control the ball in the flanks but press them when they tried to get behind their defensive lines and possibly regain possession and start counter attacks which they did successfully.

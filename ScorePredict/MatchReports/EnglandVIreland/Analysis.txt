England struggled to score past Ireland's tight defense in the first half but a early second yellow for Liam Scales for a foul on Jude resulted in a plethora of goals in the last 40 minutes of the game.
Kane opened the scoring with converting his penalty from the spot, sending the keeper the wrong way.
Antony Gordan doubled up the lead after a low cross from Livramento from the right flank which honestly should have been defended better by Ireland's defense.
England scored again after two minutes from a near post corner from Madueke which was flicked on smartly by Guehi onto the far corner which was tapped in by Gallagher from point blank range.
Bowen scored England's best goal of the night resulting from another smart Set Piece from a freekick just outside the left of the box where Jude played a pass at the edge of the box sending everyone the opposite side except for Bowen who scored right into the bottom corner.
The fifth and final goal was scored by the debutant Taylor Harwood-Bellis from a strong header which was assisted by Jude again, summing up his strong performance throughout the 90 mins.

The England captain had another impressive performance for the national team.
In this particular match, as Ireland tend to sit back and defend Kane played a very pivotal role in stretching their backline vertically by dropping deep into midfield and contributing in the build up play.
Although he had only two shots, out of which one was from the penalty spot which he converted gracefully, his ability on the ball and passing range was something to be really appreciated in this game. The penalty he scored was from a tackle on Jude in the box for which Kane played a wonderful through ball from midfield showing his threat from all around the pitch.
His touchmap further shows how influential he was in a false 9 role yesterday with his mean position much more deeper to what we are usually accustomed to see. With almost 87% passing accuracy and 12 passes into the final third, he created a significant amount of chances for both his wingers and central midfielders who offered runs into the opponent box from deep.

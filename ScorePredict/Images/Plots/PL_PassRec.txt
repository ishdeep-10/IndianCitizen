Analysis - 

-> The strikers who mostly likes to get the ball in the opponent penalty box
Haaland , Danny Ings , Vardy , Muniz , Nunez , Wood

-> Strikers who likes to drop deep into midfield to receive the ball for combination play
 Danny Welbeck , Dominic Solanke , Mateta , Wissa , Evanilson , Jackson

-> Strikers who have to drop deep because of the way their teams play (defensive)
  Onucachu , Beto , Delap (could be considered for above too), Wood

-> Strikers who likes to run in behind defensive lines on either side
   Isak , Hojlund , Nunez , Watkins , Larsen , Jackson

Merino is a special case because he is natuarally a midfielder who has been playing as a striker for Arsenal due to their injuries. He likes to still drop deep on either side to collect the ball and move around to suit how Arsenal likes to play.
